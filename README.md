### PART 2: Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control
### Project 1: Extended Kalman Filters

In this project I utilize a kalman filter that implemented in C++ to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Specifically, I use a Kalman filter, lidar measurements and radar measurements to track the bicycle's position and velocity.

Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/748/view).
